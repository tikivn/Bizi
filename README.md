# Bizi (Bazel + Tiki)

Bizi demonstrates how to build an iOS application with Bazel.

## Prerequisites

Install with [homebrew](https://brew.sh).

```bash
brew install bazel go
```

## Usage

There are three available environments: develop, staging, production.

### Command line

```bash
# build the application 
# or `make build`
bazel build //Bizi:Bizi --define environment=develop

# run the application in the simulator 
# or `make run`
bazel run //Bizi:Bizi --define environment=develop

# test the application
# or `make test`
bazel test //...

```

### Xcode

Open `/Bizi/Bizi.xcodeproj` that is generated by Tulsi application.

## Discussion

The building process takes significant time at the first build because it needs to download the dependency then start the local Bazel server.

From now on, it is lightning fast.

## Todo

- Generate Xcode that supports multiple environment via scheme.
- Generate Xcode project in with Tulsi command line.
- Integrate first party dependency from `Tikivn ` organization (starting wiht `TKNavigator`).
- Integrate third party dependencies.
- Integrate React Native.
- Integrate Flutter.
- List advantages/disadvantages of using Bazel as a legacy build system.
